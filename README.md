## Test
There are 4 types of existed images:
- Dogs (4)
- Cats (6)
- Horses (5)
- Tigers (4)

For testing the customer labels, in the `images/test` there are 2 images: `blue-cat.jpg` and `girlcat.jpg`. `blue-cat.jpg` is already tested with customer label `bluecat`. In the demo we need to run:
> Upload `girlcat.jpg` with `girlcat` customer label, then search `girlcat` should show the `girlcat.jpg`.
